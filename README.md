# VUse

This repository contains the code for VUse, an ecommerce web application for Vanderbilt University students. VUse is based on an existing GroupMe chat, "Reuse Vandy," where students communicate about the things they're looking to buy/sell.

The existing chat has many problems: listings get lost as more chats flow in, there is no way to search for a particular listing, etc. Our plan is to address all of these shortcomings and construct a beautiful user experience simultaneously.

Here are the frameworks we plan on using:
- Python (Backend)
- Python Django (Frontend + Backend)
- React Native (Frontend)
- Material UI (Frontend Styling)
- MySQL (Database)
- S3 buckets (Photo Storage/Backend)
